# Services

These are organized sections to separate configuration.

---
 
Services are everything from: `Classes, OObject, Third-Party` 
which are placed in the Dependency Injector (`$di`) and used 
throughout `controllers`, sometimes `models`, and sometimes 
`libraries` and `components`.

The `$di` is instantiated for the entire application in
`public/index.php`.

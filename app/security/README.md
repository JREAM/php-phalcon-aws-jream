# Security Folder

This stores the `Permission ACL` settings. It is primarily here because it's much easier to clear the Cache of a file
than it is to flush the Session via the `CLI`. 

The file is unreadable. When it is deleted, the page will have an error and then refresh with the proper permissions.
